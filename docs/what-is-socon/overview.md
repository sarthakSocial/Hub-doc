## What is Socon?

SoCon stands for "The Social Continent," a platform designed to empower users by putting control back into their hands. At its core, Socon is a decentralized social networking application that leverages blockchain technology to provide a secure, transparent, and user-centric experience. Unlike traditional social networks, Socon operates on principles of decentralization, ensuring that user data is owned and managed by the users themselves.

## Key Features:

3. Interoperability: Socon is designed to be interoperable with other decentralized social networking platforms. Discover how our commitment to interoperability fosters a broader, more connected social ecosystem.

4. User-Centric Experience: From a seamless onboarding process to an intuitive user interface, Socon prioritizes user experience. Learn how we strive to provide a platform that's not only secure and decentralized but also user-friendly.
