## Storage

At the heart of Socon's operational essence lies the innovative concept of "Delta Graphs." These dynamic structures serve as agile representations, capturing and depicting user interactions in a flexible and efficient manner. Within these structures, hubs act as pivotal repositories, housing all user-generated content and information. As hubs expand, the platform introduces storage limits to maintain operational efficiency. Socon employs delta pruning to manage the evolving data landscape. Older messages are systematically archived, ensuring platform efficiency and a clutter-free environment. Notably, Socon meticulously manages these limits to safeguard each user's storage allocation. For those seeking extended storage beyond these boundaries, Socon provides the option to acquire additional storage, catering to diverse user needs and preferences.

Socon's foundational framework revolves around hubs, essentially collections of deltas. To sustain platform functionality, incentives are offered to businesses constructing their applications and streamlined API services. This strategic approach fosters the proliferation of hubs, fortifying a resilient network.
