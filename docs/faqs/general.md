## How does SoCon work, technically?
SoCon operates using a combination of decentralized protocols and blockchain technology to facilitate secure communication, content sharing, and community building. 
SoCon's frontend functions similarly to other applications, sending requests to the API for posting and fetching data. The API processes these requests, validates them, and calls RPC methods of the SoCon hubs. The hub processes the data and retrieves the result, which is then sent back to the API. The API converts this result into a format similar to that obtained through any standard application, ensuring a user-friendly and familiar experience for all SoCon users and developers.
