# SoCon Accounts

Unlock the full potential of your SoCon experience by creating and managing your SoCon account. Here's a guide to help you navigate the process seamlessly:

## Creating a SoCon Account

A SoCon account serves as your gateway to the SoCon platform, allowing you to set up a unique username, showcase a profile picture, and share your thoughts through short text messages known as casts. To register a SoCon account, follow these steps:

1. **Initiate Registration:** Call the IdGateway contract to create a new SoCon ID (sid) associated with your Ethereum address.

2. **Completing Setup:** Once your sid is assigned, you'll need to acquire a username, rent storage, and add a key to fully activate your account. Note that these steps involve multiple signatures and on-chain transactions, which may be cumbersome with a regular Ethereum wallet.

3. **Use Socon app for Seamless Experience:** We recommend using [our Socon mobile app](#) or [Socon web app](#), a specialized SoCon wallet designed to streamline the entire account setup process. Socon operates with a separate Ethereum account for transaction signing, ensuring the security of your main Ethereum account.

## Recovering Your Account

Security is a priority, and SoCon provides a straightforward account recovery process. Follow these steps to ensure you can recover your account if needed:

1. **Set Recovery Address:** Specify a recovery address during the account creation process or at any time thereafter.

2. **Trusted Services or Self-Management:** Users can set the recovery address to trusted services for hassle-free recovery. Alternatively, manage the recovery process independently using a regular Ethereum wallet.

Embrace the SoCon community by creating and managing your SoCon account efficiently. Whether you're expressing yourself through casts or exploring the vast features, a well-managed account enhances your overall SoCon experience.
